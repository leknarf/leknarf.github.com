Like many blogs, this one will be an opportunity for me to spew baseless advice and hyperbole. Seeing how I have no previous blogging experience, I'm completely unqualified to discuss how to build a new blog, and therefore have no reservations about telling others exactly how they should proceed.

Launching a new blog isn't dissimilar to launching a startup. In fact, the difficulties in launching a blog are effectively a sub-set of the key problems to solve when creating a startup. Specifically, building a new blog requires you to figure out the following questions:

<!-- more -->

 - Who are your potential readers?
 - How will those readers find your blog?
 - Will those readers subscribe, share, comment, or otherwise engage with your content?
 - What do you expect from a "successful" blog?

If these questions sound familiar, that's because they are essential to the first two steps in Steve Blank's [The Four Steps to the Epiphany](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0976470705&linkCode=as2&tag=leknarf-20"), namely "Customer Discovery" and "Customer Validation".

Discovery is a fairly obvious requirement for a new blog--I don't believe many folks start a blog without at least intending to find readers--but Validation is a little more surprising. For a commercial startup, validation usually revolves around assessing willingness-to-pay or (more murkily) the ability-to-monetize. {" A blog doesn't have to become a revenue stream to be successful, but it is important to identify some possible benefits and then consider how feasible they are. "}
{% endpullquote %}

In my case, this blog might help with the following goals:

  - Clearly articulate my rambling ideas: Ideas are tough to nail down. Something that sounds wonderful bouncing around in your head can look outright preposterous once it finds its way to paper. Writing things down and sharing them is a straightforward way to develop intellectual honesty.
  - Establish some bona fides. Perhaps you've been reading this blog and thought to yourself, "That chap seems to know what's up." That'd be pretty okay.
  - Direct some traffic to my [current startup]({{site.current_company_url}}). This is starting to get more difficult, but is still pretty reasonable. Readers of this blog probably like startups, I've got one, so perhaps you'd like to take a look at mine?



#Requirements:

 - at least one post
 - good enough design
 - social sharing links
 - feed subscription
 - analytics
 - photos

#Ignored features:

 - comments
  Many blogs have comments. This one does not. Discus may be simple to setup, but it's still an extra compoment that isn't strickly necessary. You can discuss posts on hacker news or google+.
 - better design
   At the time of writing, this blog has exactly one reader (me). A pretty design can help retain readers and convert visitors into subscribers, but it won't help get those visitors in the first place.

 - An "about me" page.
  I might add one later, but honestly, why would you care?
