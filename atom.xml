    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following are my notes from the 2013 AWS Summit Keynote presentation. These notes are largely for my benefit (mostly to make sure I&#8217;m actually paying attention during the talks) but may be interesting to others.</p>

<p>I wrote these notes during the presentation and have not diligently separated my thoughts from those of the speakers. It&#8217;s possible I have misunderstood some points or added thoughts of my own. Please assume any good ideas were originally those of the speaker. Any bad ideas are either my own musings or a misinterpreting of the presentation in question.</p>

<h2>Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO</h2>

<ul>
<li>AWS started with just S3. EC2 was second.</li>
<li>NASA JPL is an AWS customer: Mars Rover data is stored and shared on S3.</li>
<li>AWS philosophy: No lock-in: any OS, any middleware, any software, etc.</li>
<li>AWS Marketplace one year in: 25 categories, 778 products.</li>
<li>31 AWS price reductions since 2006. This drives a cycle of growing the customer base, achieving economies of scale, and further reducing costs.</li>
<li>&#8220;Computing should be like turning on a light switch: you never even consider the cost&#8221;</li>
<li>AWS Trusted Advisor: Customer Infrastructure Audits will review your AWS usage and suggest ways to decrease your costs.</li>
<li>AWS follows a startup model for new products: new products are launched with limited features, so Amazon can learn how customers are using the tools before developing them more fully.</li>
<li>Local secondary indices for DynamoDB: provides relational db flexibility on top of dynamo&#8217;s scalability.</li>
<li>Success of cloud computing follows an existing economic pattern:

<ul>
<li>Reduced customer loyalty to large brands</li>
<li>Highly uncertain environments require flexibility:

<ul>
<li>Use resources on demand</li>
<li>Release unneeded resources</li>
<li>Pay for what you use</li>
<li>Leverage other providers&#8217; core competencies</li>
<li>Replace fixed costs with variable rates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> No (or highly reduced) upfront capital expenses</li>
<li> Samsung avoided a 34 million upfront expense on their SmartHub project</li>
<li> Lower variable expense than DiY.</li>
<li> Less guesswork in capacity planning.

<ul>
<li>Amazon.com used to target +50% spare capacity above peak traffic spikes</li>
<li>Now they elasticially scale up and down</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/29/bacon-cheese-kugel/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-29T19:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/29/bacon-cheese-kugel</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut">inexplicable reason</a>, the internet didn&#8217;t already have a recipe for bacon cheese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel">kugel</a>. I decided to fix that:</p>

<h1>Bacon Cheese Kugel</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 pound noodles. You may use potato noodles if you&#8217;re making this for Passover</li>
<li>3/4 pound cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
<li>3/4 pound bacon</li>
<li>8 eggs</li>
<li>kosher salt</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h2>Preparation:</h2>

<p>Preheat oven to 350 F.</p>

<p>Boil the noodles in salted water for half as long as instructed on the package. They should be slightly soft, but still much harder than what you&#8217;d normally consider done. Strain over a container and set aside the pasta water, you&#8217;ll need to later.</p>

<p>While the noodles are boiling, cut the bacon into large pieces (around 1 square inch). Cook over low heat (lower than usual for bacon) until around 3/4 done (the bacon should not turn crispy).</p>

<p>Scramble the eggs, add the cheese, then stir in a small amount the pasta water (around 1/2 cup). You just want to warm the mixture without shocking the eggs. Add the noodles, stir, then the bacon (including the drippings). This mixture will be very thick. Stir in more of the pasta water until it&#8217;s about the consistency of cottage cheese.</p>

<p>Bake covered for around 45 minutes. It&#8217;s ready once the center has set. Serve warm (this kugel will be exceptionally thick when cold).</p>

    <link href="http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/13/find-out-when-to-post-on-hacker-news/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-13T16:15:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/13/find-out-when-to-post-on-hacker-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of my efforts to <a href="http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/02/09/a-blog-is-a-mini-startup/">promote this new blog</a>, I&#8217;ve been submitting posts to <a href="news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a>. Not surprisingly, my initial submissions went roughly nowhere. Less than 100 visitors saw the posts.</p>

<p>Stepping back, I decided to think a little more about timing my submissions to get better results. <a href="http://hnpickup.appspot.com/">HN Pickup Ratio</a> looked like a nice representation of the relevant factors, but it is sadly defunct, as App Engine has been blocked from scraping hacker news. I liked the concept enough to write my own implementation, which is now available here: <a href="http://hnnotify.leknarf.net">HN Notify</a>.</p>

<p>Timing my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5335241">last submission</a> was exceptionally successful: it reached the front page of hacker news and was seen by 3,000 readers.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>Assuming you want your HN submission to reach the front page, then it&#8217;s important to post at times when scores on the new page are relatively high compared to the front page.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This assumes your goal is to reach the front page. I don&#8217;t actually know how many people skim over the &#8216;new&#8217; links, but it&#8217;s fairly obvious that a far greater number of people only look at the first 30 links on the home page.</p>

<p>For the purposes of discussion, I&#8217;m going to assume a very simplistic model of the HN front page: new stories with more points will outrank older stories with less points. That is, I&#8217;m ignoring any effects existing karma has on a user&#8217;s submission and any factors related to when a story gets upvotes. If we assume that a new story needs to get more points than an existing story in order to replace it on the front page, then the following is straightforward:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a good time to submit when scores on the front page are low. If the lowest-ranked story has 10 points, it will be much easier to replace than if the lowest-ranked story has 100 points.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a good time to post when scores on the new page are high. If the highest-ranked story on the new page only has 2 points, it doesn&#8217;t seem likely that your submission will fare much better.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Differences from HN Pickup</h2>

<p>HN Pickup introduced this concept of comparing the lowest-front-page with the highest-new-page scores. It graphs the mean of the last 6 data points in each category along with the ratio of the two averages. From what I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s fairly rare for new page scores to exceed those on the front page, so I&#8217;m just considering the difference between the two. I also don&#8217;t think the mean is an appropriate statistic, given how easy it is for extremely popular submissions to skew the results. Instead, I&#8217;m using the second-highest and second-lowest scores. This provides some protection against outliers.</p>

<p>I disliked the idea of compulsively watching a graph update, so I added an alert mechanism. If you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/HNNotify">@HNNotify</a> on twitter, you&#8217;ll be able to receive notifications of opportune submission times. It won&#8217;t post more than once an hour and also ignores times when the high score on the front page is less than 10, which reduces the noise in the feed.</p>

<p>When you are compulsively waiting for a submission window, it&#8217;s nice to see the chart update in real-time. This chart updates automatically, without refreshing the page.</p>

<p>Since HN Pickup was blocked, I don&#8217;t want to scrape HN directly. Instead, this uses the Unofficial Hacker News API as its data source, which has been reliable so far.</p>

<h2>Architecture &amp; Implementation</h2>

<p>This sort of real-time data scraping/representation is a great fit for <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, which is a very exciting hosted database service. They provide a REST API that lets you write and read data from anywhere, which means I don&#8217;t need to run a web server. Instead, the project frontend is an entirely static page running on Github Pages, which fetches updated data directly from Firebase using javascript.</p>

<p>The backend is a simple python script running on Heroku. This handles polling the HN API, writing the data to Firebase, and sending notifications to twitter.</p>

<p>The result is a very maintainable weekend project that doesn&#8217;t actually require me to run any servers. Firebase, Github Pages, Heroku, and Twitter handle all of the responsibilities I&#8217;d usually need a server for, without forcing me to deal with security, scalability, or monitoring.</p>

    <link href="http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/06/techops-pre-launch-checklist-for-web-apps/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-06T11:49:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/06/techops-pre-launch-checklist-for-web-apps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As my startup gears up for our first paid marketing campaign, I&#8217;ve been giving some thought to the necessary preparations a developer should go through before driving some traffic to a web app.</p>

<p>In general, the goal isn&#8217;t to prevent every possible problem. In addition to being impossible, any attempts to do so would almost certainly involve premature engineering. Instead, my goal is to be adequately prepared for unforeseeable problems. The important thing is to ensure I&#8217;ll be notified when a problems occur and that I&#8217;ll have enough information to investigate and fix said problems.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re hosted on AWS, so this list assumes you&#8217;re running in a similar environment. Managed platforms like Heroku take care of much of this for you.</p>

<p>In no particular order, the following should be completed before aggressively promoting a new web app:</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Prepare for disaster</h1>

<ul>
<li>Setup fully automated, zero-downtime deployments: Once people are using your site, you can&#8217;t bring down the server to make changes. If you haven&#8217;t already set up a smooth deployment process, this should be your first priority.</li>
<li>Automatically collect database backups and store in S3: hourly x 48, daily x 14, weekly x 8, and monthly x forever.</li>
<li>Restore the database from these backups to a developer&#8217;s machine at least once.</li>
<li>Ship your log files to a hosted retention service (Splunk, Loggly, Papertrail). Or prepare your own scripts to copy files to S3.</li>
<li>Setup application performance monitoring and alerting (New Relic). If your site gets a sudden traffic spike, this should notify you that you&#8217;ve exceeded your capacity.</li>
<li>Server monitoring (New Relic): If your server is running out of hard drive space or if an errant process is consuming all the CPU/RAM, you&#8217;ll want to get an email before the site goes down.</li>
<li>Uptime alerting/monitoring (New Relic and Pingdom): If the site does go down, you&#8217;ll obviously want to know about it. New Relic does this via email, but Pingdom&#8217;s mobile app is free and excellent.</li>
<li>Error alerting (Airbrake, Exceptional): Again, if something goes wrong, you want to find out about it.</li>
<li>If your application doesn&#8217;t require a high level of user privacy, then you should be able to log into your site as a given user. Odd problems will pop up that only affect one user. It&#8217;s a lot easier to investigate when you can see exactly what that user is seeing.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Basic security checks</h1>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade to the latest versions or install security patches for all the major components of your stack, including your framework (Rails/Django/etc.), web server (nginx, apache, etc.), and OS.</li>
<li>Install Fail2Ban on any publicly available servers.</li>
<li>Configure firewalls to restrict access to any server that don&#8217;t need to be publicly available (i.e. your database, message broker, etc.) and block all but the necessary ports.</li>
<li>Change any horrendously insecure passwords you may have. Many startups use absurd passwords like &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;test123&#8221; for their admin accounts when starting out. These should be changed as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Prep for scaling</h1>

<ul>
<li>Serve static assets from S3 or a CDN (CloudFlare, CloudFront)</li>
<li>Setup a caching layer (Memcached, Redis, Varish)</li>
<li>Point your DNS entry to a load balancer, not an individual server. ELB makes this easy. If you do take on a massive amount of traffic, you can always add more web servers to the load balancer.</li>
<li>You should have the ability to scale up to N web servers at any time (Chef).</li>
<li>If something odd happens on one of your servers, the two points above make the solution easy: just spin up a new web node, add it to the load balancer, and then remove the failing node. Don&#8217;t bother trying to fix or even diagnose one-off failures.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/01/startups-should-spend-more-on-marketing-than-engineering/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-01T06:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/03/01/startups-should-spend-more-on-marketing-than-engineering</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Grabowski&#8217;s <a href="http://leknarf.net/assets/grabowski_marketing.pdf">Who Is Going To Buy The Darn Thing?</a> isn&#8217;t nearly as popular as Steve Blank&#8217;s various works, but both share a similar underlying sentiment: that a startup&#8217;s marketing functions are as important if not more important than product development.</p>

<p>Grabowski&#8217;s contribution is a simple quantitative metric, the Marketing/Engineering ratio, and the claim that successful startups spend more on marketing than engineering (an M/E ratio greater than 1).</p>

<h2>Defining the M/E ratio</h2>

<p>To start, it&#8217;s important to clarify what &#8220;marketing&#8221; is in this context. Although the term is often used to describe a broad range of activities including sales and advertising, Grabowski takes a much narrower view:</p>

<blockquote><p>Marketing is defined as the up-front process that comes before the product is ready. (Promoting and selling come after the product is ready.)</p><footer><strong>Grabowski &#8220;Who Is Going To Buy The Darn Thing?&#8221;</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>Grabowski&#8217;s writing pre-dates the Lean Startup Movement, so his definition unfortunately implies a hard separation between pre-launch and post-launch activities. Viewed from a Lean perspective, he is essentially arguing that &#8220;learning&#8221; have its own line item on a budget and that startups should spend more time/effort/money on learning instead of building. Arguing for an M/E ratio greater than 1 is just another way of saying we should spend more time learning about what to build than actually building. That&#8217;s a fairly obvious statement when put plainly, but it&#8217;s still surprising how many entrepreneurs get mired down in product development before actually confirming that their target market exists.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Distinguishing marketing from sales makes the M/E ratio a particularly strong statement. Many startups implicitly group marketing, advertising, and sales into one &#8220;customer acquisition&#8221; category. While advertising and sales are important (I think many startups would benefit from increasing their advertising budgets), they are not a substitute for true marketing efforts, which should be focused on discovering customer needs. Just spending equal amounts on engineering and customer acquisition is not enough. Startups need to invest in learning before and while building a product and then again invest in sales once a product begins to find market fit. I agree with <a href="http://davidcummings.org/2011/04/25/the-31-customer-acquisition-to-engineering-spend-ratio/">David Cummings&#8217; claim</a> that startups should budget for a 3:1 customer acquisition to engineering ratio, but would go one step further and argue that a significant part (more than half) of that customer acquisition spend should go to upfront marketing.</p>

<p>In fact, many sales teams don&#8217;t understand marketing. Although sales and marketing are often seen as complementary skill sets, Grabowski cites an example of a firm where: &#8220;Many engineering efforts had been urged by the sales force, which had hoped to exhibit technology that would make customers&#8217; jaws drop.&#8221; He goes on to describe this as a common pitfall: &#8220;Mistaking selling for marketing&#8221;. Sales teams are well positioned to communicate with customers, but there is a fundamental difference between pitching your wares and listening to what the customer wants. The best salesmen already know to listen to their customers, but not everyone has the patience and charm of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671027034/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0671027034&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=leknarf-20">Dale Carnegie</a>.</p>

<h2>Minimizing risk</h2>

<blockquote><p>Technology-based startups present two types of technical risk. First, there is the risk that the startup cannot make the technology work. The second risk […] is that the startup does make the technology work, but that they are developing the wrong technology. Up-front marketing can guide engineering to the right technology.</p><footer><strong>Grabowski &#8220;Who Is Going To Buy The Darn Thing?&#8221;</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>The embarrassing truth for most developers is that software engineering is relatively easy: few software companies have failed because they couldn&#8217;t get their technology to work. Pharmaceutical companies have real technology risk: you could easily spend millions trying to develop a cure that never works. Aerospace companies have real technology risk: a single unchecked failure would not only destroy the company, it could literally kill.</p>

<p>For most software companies, the worst case scenario is that the product needs to be shelved for 6 months while the engineering team re-architects from scratch. Twitter and Tumbler both went those phases of significant instability when their user base outgrew the capacity of their early prototypes, but both were able to overhaul their software with minimal business impact. Spending 6 months building something that no one wants is much worse than spending 1 month building something desirable that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<h2>Budgeting for marketing</h2>

<p>The Marketing/Engineering ratio&#8217;s iron-clad simplicity is its main appeal. It&#8217;s easy to read Steve Blank, decide to &#8220;get out of the building&#8221;, and then completely shirk any meaningful change in activity. If a single founder worked 4 days a week writing software and spent the fifth talking to customers, he might feel like he&#8217;s following Steve Blank&#8217;s advice, but an M/E ratio of .25 is clearly substandard according to Grabowski.</p>

<p>That simplicity is wonderful for planning. I have woefully little experience crafting marketing plans for new products, but have been preparing engineering estimates for most of my career. Targeting an M/E ratio (or more), makes it easy to infer the marketing budget from engineering estimates:</p>

<blockquote><p>Engineers know how to develop an engineering budget. Simply use the engineering budget to establish the size and timing of the up-front marketing budget.</p><footer><strong>Grabowski &#8220;Who Is Going To Buy The Darn Thing?&#8221;</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>Committing to this ratio and maintaining it for the life of a project is a natural check on feature sprawl and cost-overruns. If someone wants to add a pet feature that &#8220;only&#8221; requires one-engineering-week of effort, he&#8217;d best invest one-marketing-week upfront to verify the feature is actually desirable. If the initial engineering estimates were low and it&#8217;s now clear that the project will require 3 times as much development time, then the company should increase its marketing efforts 3-fold.</p>

<p>Conversely, cheap engineering efforts can be pursued with minimal marketing. If the concept for a new feature can accurately be expressed as a 1-day MVP, then the team only needs to spend 1 day interviewing customers before proceeding.</p>

<p>By establishing a firm M/E ratio, startups can align the interests of their marketing and engineering teams. Instead of throwing new feature requests over the wall, marketers are incentivised to justify their requests with firm data, since additional engineering commitments will also place additional demands on the marketing team.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking of various ways to validate a startup idea and <a href="http://kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> stands out as an exceptionally interesting option. This idea isn&#8217;t strictly new, <a href="http://customerdevlabs.com/2012/12/02/crowdtesting-using-crowdfunding-kickstarter-test-an-mvp/">Justin Wilcox</a> described the concept on his blog and at the 2012 Lean Startup Conference.</p>

<h2>What is an MVP?</h2>

<p>The term Minimum Viable Product is often abused. Sometimes used as a synonym for &#8220;prototype&#8221;, some so-called MVPs have an excess of fully-developed features that are irrelevant to testing customer interest. A common mistake is to assume that a MVP needs to satisfy a customer in order to be viable, which can easily lead to building a full prototype.</p>

<p>Eric Ries offers a concise description of how IMVU should have started, instead of building a prototype:</p>

<blockquote><p>What we should have done, and what we did for a lot of features thereafter, is started with a landing page that promised people that product. Then we should have taken out the AdWords we were planning to take out, drive traffic to that landing page, and offer people to buy the experience that we are talking about.</p><p>What we would have found out if we were doing that experiment is 0% of people would have clicked through, which means it doesn’t matter what is on the second page.</p><footer><strong>Eric Ries</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html'>What Is the Minimum Viable Product?</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>A proper MVP just needs to test whether someone would pay for a product or service, it doesn&#8217;t need to include (and should not include) any of the actual features.</p>

<h2>Enter crowdfunding</h2>

<p>A Crowdfunding campaign is not a way to test an MVP, it is an MVP in its own right. Ideally, you should be able to launch and complete a crowdfunding campaign without building a prototype. In fact, the core features of a Kickstarter campaign are effectively the same as any MVP:</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>A high level description of your concept</li>
<li>A way for people to pay</li>
<li>A time limit, after which point an unsuccessful campaign must be abandoned</li>
</ul>


<p>Starting with a crowdfunding campaign instead of a prototype avoids many of the common lean stumbling blocks. When building a software prototype MVP, it&#8217;s difficult to decide how much effort should go into frontend design work. On one hand, any work that doesn&#8217;t add new functionality doesn&#8217;t seem to be minimal, so polishing an app&#8217;s appearance should be considered waste. But an ugly product is obviously unmarketable, so some amount of polish is important. With a kickstarter campaign, it&#8217;s clear that including a video dramatically improves conversion and is worth the effort. But it&#8217;s also obvious that spending 6 months of full time effort to craft the perfect landing page isn&#8217;t worthwhile. Preparing a campaign naturally forces you to focus on marketing instead of development, which is much more valuable in a startup&#8217;s initial stage.</p>

<p>The emphasis on collecting payment avoids another potential mistake. A landing page that receives 100,000 unique visitors in a month is impressive, but is ultimately a failure unless some of those 100,000 are willing to pay. Crowdfunding doesn&#8217;t force you to monetize your actual product immediately, but it does ensure that at least some of your customers are willing to spend money.</p>

<p>The time limit dramatically reduces your risks as a entrepreneur. Specifically, it limits your opportunity risk. If you launch a crowdfunding campaign and fail to meet your goal in the time alloted, then you have a pretty clear signal to move on and try something else. Successfully funding a campaign doesn&#8217;t guarantee that your target market is large enough to support a company, but it at least confirms the market exists.</p>

<h2>What to offer in your campaign</h2>

<p>Not only does a crowdfunding campaign replace building a prototype, it lets you consider prototype ideas that wouldn&#8217;t be commercially viable in their own right. For example, freemium apps are increasingly becoming the dominant model for mobile apps (<a href="http://build.developereconomics.com/freemium-beats-premium-says-app-annie/">freemium apps generate 69 percent of the worldwide iOS app revenue and 75 percent of global Android app revenues</a>). I&#8217;d be hesitant to develop a free app without funding, but would be very happy to build a free app to meet a crowdfunding obligation. I could then expand that free app with premium features later, hopefully turning a small project into a sustainable business. Even if those premium features fail, at least I&#8217;d have the crowdfunding proceeds as compensation for my time. Alternatively, if you already had a moderately popular app, you could use crowdfunding to fund new features, thus ensuring that you only build new features that people actually want.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything wrong with using crowdfunding to raise capital for actual commercial products. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android">Pebble</a> is selling a watch for $150 after raising more than 10 million dollars on Kickstarter. Although part of me feels that collecting donations is more appropriate for artistic or free projects, the truth is that commercial projects are completely ethical. If your description is honest and backers contribute voluntarily, then you have no moral obligation to provide anything other than what you explicitly promise.</p>

<h2>Defining your goal</h2>

<p>Unlike a traditional crowdfunding campaign, the fundamental goal of a crowdfunding MVP isn&#8217;t to raise capital. Money is certainly appealing, but the real value of a successful campaign is knowing that other people value your concept and are willing to pay for it. Justin Wilcox described in his proposal how you can A/B test multiple campaigns to test different price points. Although I think that&#8217;s a great addition (especially considering how his test found a higher conversion rate for the higher price point), I don&#8217;t think determining how much someone will pay is as important at the initial stage as determining whether anyone will pay. I think there would be more value in A/B testing different marketing pitches than different prices.</p>

<p>I do agree with his advice to define your goal in terms of the number of backers (5,000 in his case) instead of some dollar value. Finding backers for your concept means that other people have and recognize the problem you are trying to solve. Knowing that, you can market more ambitious products or services to this base in the future (such as the premium features mentioned above).</p>

<h2>Kickstarter and its alternatives</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the terms &#8220;crowdfunding&#8221; and &#8220;Kickstarter&#8221; interchangeably, which seems fair given the company&#8217;s success in popularizing the concept. But there are certainly other alternatives, such as <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> and <a href="http://selfstarter.us/">Selfstarter</a>, which might be more appropriate. Kickstarter&#8217;s popularity provides immediate visibility for your project and their reputation adds legitimacy, but they do set restrictions that might preclude your project. In particular, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines">their guidelines</a> state: &#8220;Design and Technology projects that are developing new hardware or products must show on their project pages a functional prototype&#8221;. I&#8217;m unsure how often this rule is enforced, but it certainly seems to rule out our ideal scenario of launching a campaign instead of building a prototype. Depending on the complexity of your concept, you might be able to build a very simple proof-of-concept and then ask for funding to complete the feature set. Kickstarter also forbids concepts that require on-going maintenance, which eliminates most Software-as-a-Service concepts as well.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe IndieGoGo has any similar restrictions. Selfstarter (as a DIY option) is certainly available for any project.</p>

<h2>A place to start</h2>

<p>I think this concept is particularly compelling because it offers non-technical founders a concrete place to start. Convincing a developer to build your prototype is difficult, especially if you only have a vague idea and no hard skills to offer. Creating a crowdfunding campaign requires you to clearly articulate your vision and to pitch your concept in an exciting way, which is exactly what you&#8217;ll need to do in order to recruit. A small amount of crowdfunding capital demonstrates significant traction, even more so than a lengthy waiting list on LaunchRock. More importantly, even a failed campaign isn&#8217;t a waste of time. The skills you need to successfully complete a crowdfunding campaign are easily transferable to marketing an early stage startup, so it&#8217;s certainly worthwhile nurturing those skills early.</p>

    <id>http://leknarf.net/blog/2013/02/09/a-blog-is-a-mini-startup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Launching a new blog isn&#8217;t dissimilar to launching a startup. In fact, the difficulties in launching a blog are effectively a sub-set of the key problems to solve when creating a startup. Specifically, building a new blog requires you to figure out the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are your potential readers?</li>
<li>How will those readers find your blog?</li>
<li>Will those readers subscribe, share, comment, or otherwise engage with your content?</li>
<li>What do you expect from a &#8220;successful&#8221; blog?</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p>If these questions sound familiar, that&#8217;s because they are fundamental to the first two steps in Steve Blank&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0976470705&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=leknarf-20" title="">The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a>, namely &#8220;Customer Discovery&#8221; and &#8220;Customer Validation&#8221;. Creating and marketing a blog is a great way to practice the customer development skills necessary for an early startup, without having to worry about the parallel challenge of product development.</p>

<h2>Customer Discovery</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Marketing your blog is almost entirely a problem of execution: you don&#8217;t need a clever new strategy, you just need to get out there and hustle.'>
Discovery is a fairly obvious requirement for a new blog. I don&#8217;t believe many folks start a blog without at least intending to find readers. Fortunately, the process of finding readers for a blog is far more straightforward than discovering potential customers for a startup. There&#8217;s already a large market of people who read other blogs, you just need to convince them that yours is at least worth a cursory skim. And there&#8217;s already an established base of communities like <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> that exist primarily for readers to discover, share, and discuss new content. Marketing your blog is almost entirely a problem of execution: you don&#8217;t need a clever new strategy, you just need to get out there and hustle. This is far easier than discovering customers for a new product category.
</span></p>

<p>More importantly, by accepting that building a readership just requires some honest labor, you can avoid a common pitfall. Smart people (particularly developers) enjoy thinking about ways to do their jobs more efficiently. When building a startup, it&#8217;s tempting to spend so much time thinking about ways to reach new customers that you never actually get around to speaking to any. This is obviously absurd in the context of building a blog&#8217;s readership. Working on developing your blog&#8217;s reach is a great way to develop a habit of doing instead of just planning.</p>

<h2>Customer Validation</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='A blog doesn&#8217;t have to become a revenue stream to be successful, but it is important to identify some possible benefits, consider how feasible they are, and figure out what sort of readers you want.'>
Validation requires a little more thought. For a commercial startup, validation usually revolves around assessing willingness to pay. A blog doesn&#8217;t have to become a revenue stream to be successful, but it is important to identify some possible benefits, consider how feasible they are, and figure out what sort of readers you want. It&#8217;s not necessary for your readers to pay you directly, but it is important to identify some sort of desired action you want to encourage.
</span></p>

<p>In particular, some plausible motivations for blogging are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Articulate and develop your own thoughts: Thinking is easy; writing is hard. Ideas are tough to nail down. Something that sounds wonderful bouncing around in your head can look outright preposterous once it finds its way to paper. Writing things down and sharing them is a straightforward way to develop intellectual honesty. You can get some benefits from writing even without a readership, but ideally, you&#8217;ll want to find thoughtful readers who are interested in discussing your ideas and challenging your assumptions. If you happen to build up a large pool of readers who never comment or engage with you, then you haven&#8217;t found the right readers and should re-consider your discovery efforts.</li>
<li>Establish some bona fides. Perhaps you&#8217;ve been reading this blog and thought to yourself, &#8220;That chap seems to know what&#8217;s up.&#8221; Validation for this goal can be as simple as collecting points. Unlike the above, silent readers are okay for this goal, provided that they&#8217;re willing to up vote your content on social media sites.</li>
<li>Direct some traffic to another project, such as my <a href="http://topshelfclothes.com">current startup</a>. This is starting to get more difficult, but is still pretty reasonable. Readers of this blog probably like startups, I&#8217;ve got one, so perhaps you&#8217;d like to take a look at mine? This thought process quickly breaks down if there isn&#8217;t a straightforward connection between the blog&#8217;s content and the project in question. A photo-blog of cat cartoons is odd marketing for an enterprise software company, but might work out if <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">done right</a>. The key metric here is simple: you want to review the conversation funnel for your other project and compare traffic from your blog with other traffic sources.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Practice the hard stuff</h2>

<p>Startups are hard. There&#8217;s no way around that. You&#8217;re unlikely to find immediate success regardless, but you can improve your chances by developing relevant skills. Software developers are often tempted to focus on becoming better developers. Product development is certainly relevant to any startup, but the challenge for most early startups is finding customers. Learning the latest web framework won&#8217;t help you validate a business model, but finding readers for a new blog is a great way to learn and practice customer development.</p>
